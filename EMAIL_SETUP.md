## Option 3: Netlify Forms (If deploying to Netlify)

### Step 1: Add Netlify Attribute
Add `data-netlify="true"` to your form in `src/components/sections/Contact.tsx`:

```tsx
<form onSubmit={onSubmit} className="space-y-6" data-netlify="true">
```

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the contact form
3. Fill out and submit a test message
4. Check your email inbox

## Troubleshooting

- **No email received**: Check your spam folder
- **Error messages**: Check the browser console for details
- **Environment variables not working**: Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root and restart your dev server

## Current Fallback

If no email service is configured, the form will open your default email client with a pre-filled message (mailto fallback).
