# Building Resilient Applications with Kubernetes

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, but building truly resilient applications requires more than just deploying containers to a cluster.

## Understanding Resilience in Kubernetes

Resilience isn't just about handling failures—it's about designing systems that can adapt, recover, and continue operating under various conditions.

### Key Principles

1. **Redundancy and High Availability**
   - Multi-zone deployments
   - Pod disruption budgets
   - Rolling updates with zero downtime

2. **Observability and Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive logging with structured data
   - Metrics collection and alerting
   - Distributed tracing for complex microservices

3. **Resource Management**
   - Proper resource requests and limits
   - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
   - Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)

## Practical Implementation

### Deployment Strategies
\`\`\`yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: resilient-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v1.0.0
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
\`\`\`

## Lessons from Production

During my internship at Avanade, I worked on migrating large-scale applications to Kubernetes. Here are the key insights:

- **Start with health checks**: Proper liveness and readiness probes are crucial
- **Monitor everything**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive monitoring
- **Plan for failures**: Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms
- **Automate recovery**: Use operators for complex application management

## Conclusion

Building resilient Kubernetes applications is an ongoing journey. The key is to start with solid foundations and continuously improve based on real-world feedback and monitoring data.

# React Performance: Beyond the Basics

Performance optimization in React goes far beyond just using \`React.memo\` and \`useCallback\`. Let's explore advanced techniques that can dramatically improve your application's user experience.

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

\`\`\`typescript
// Route-based code splitting
const BlogPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/Blog'));
const ProjectsPage = lazy(() => import('./pages/Projects'));

// Component-based code splitting
const HeavyComponent = lazy(() => 
  import('./components/HeavyComponent').then(module => ({
    default: module.HeavyComponent
  }))
);
\`\`\`

### 2. Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists

When dealing with thousands of items, virtual scrolling is essential:

\`\`\`typescript
import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const VirtualizedList = ({ items }) => (
  <List
    height={600}
    itemCount={items.length}
    itemSize={50}
    itemData={items}
  >
    {Row}
  </List>
);
\`\`\`

### 3. Optimizing Bundle Size

- **Tree shaking**: Import only what you need
- **Bundle analysis**: Use webpack-bundle-analyzer
- **Dynamic imports**: Load features on demand

## Performance Monitoring

### Web Vitals Integration

\`\`\`typescript
import { getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB } from 'web-vitals';

getCLS(console.log);
getFID(console.log);
getFCP(console.log);
getLCP(console.log);
getTTFB(console.log);
\`\`\`

## Real-World Impact

In a recent project, applying these techniques resulted in:
- 40% reduction in initial bundle size
- 60% improvement in Time to Interactive (TTI)
- 25% increase in user engagement metrics

## Memory Management

### Avoiding Memory Leaks

\`\`\`typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = eventEmitter.subscribe(handleEvent);
  
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // Cleanup!
  };
}, []);
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is a continuous process. Start with measuring, identify bottlenecks, apply targeted optimizations, and measure again. The key is to focus on user-perceived performance rather than just technical metrics.

Remember: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - but informed optimization based on real user data is essential for great user experiences.
