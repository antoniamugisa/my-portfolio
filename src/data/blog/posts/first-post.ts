    content: `# Endings Are Just Beginnings

I've been thinking of my university experience now that it's coming to an end. The routes to campus I've walked, the late-night conversations I've had with friends on various street corners, the mornings where my ears still rang from the night before, dancing without a care in the world. It's hitting me that I'll no longer experience those moments again, and it hit quite hard on my flight back home.

I am so relieved that this degree is coming to a close. To finally put the academic anxiety to rest and place my focus on things that I care about and want to grow. So many new things are taking place in my life that make me feel grateful for the way things turned out. I definitely could have dodged a lot of suffering here and there by making different choices lol but lessons were learned, lessons to move forward with.

This experience was definitely something lol. A train ride I honestly did not think would ever stop but yet here I am, going to graduate, move to a new city, and begin a whole new chapter of a life I've been dreaming of.

I'm filled with so much gratitude for Halifax, the people I've met, the friends I will hold on to, the hurt experienced and the love gained. This past year taught me so much about myself, the large amounts of love I have to give, the joy I can experience and the strength to forgive myself for things I cannot change. I can speak so much on this but a girl will wait till graduation to get sappy about this city.

For now, I'm really excited to have a space to share my thoughts on my career in tech (this job hunt has nearly killed me guys), some personal ramblings about life, the highs and lows of this industry and its ever-changing climate and share (hopefully helpful) technical tidbits I'm gaining currently! I'm working on projects that have sparked my fire for software development again and can't wait to share my progress on them.

Endings suck but new beginnings are exciting so I will continue, by the lovely words of Olivia Dean, to take baby steps and fall forward.
