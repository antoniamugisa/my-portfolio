Performance optimization is crucial for creating successful web applications. In today's fast-paced digital world, users expect instant loading times and smooth interactions. This guide covers the essential techniques every developer should know.

## Understanding Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are the key metrics Google uses to measure user experience:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
LCP measures loading performance. Aim for LCP of 2.5 seconds or less.

### First Input Delay (FID)
FID measures interactivity. Aim for FID of 100 milliseconds or less.

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
CLS measures visual stability. Aim for CLS of 0.1 or less.

## Optimization Techniques

### Image Optimization
- Use modern formats like WebP and AVIF
- Implement lazy loading
- Provide multiple sizes for responsive images
- Compress images without losing quality

### Code Splitting
- Split your JavaScript bundles
- Use dynamic imports for route-based splitting
- Implement component-level code splitting

### Caching Strategies
- Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- Use service workers for offline functionality
- Leverage CDNs for static assets

## Measuring Performance

Use tools like:
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- WebPageTest
- Chrome DevTools
- Lighthouse

Remember: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - but informed optimization based on real user data is essential for great user experiences.`,
